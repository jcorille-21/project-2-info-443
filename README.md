# Project 2: Mongoose

## By Jason Xu, Crosby Huang, David Xie, Jerome Orille

# Introduction

Mongoose is an Object Relational Model (ORM) that is specifically developed for Node.js applications to connect to MongoDB databases. It aims to make working with MongoDB easier for developers as the library offers features such as enforcing strongly-typed schemeas. We are planning on researching Mongoose. Mongoose is used as an interface to MongoDB by defining models to interact with the database. Some interactions that users can do include querying and any other SQL commands. This makes it necessary for users to use to access a MongoDB database.
