# Project 2: Mongoose

# Introduction

Mongoose provides an Object Relational Model (ORM) for Node.js applications to connect to MongoDB NoSQL databases. This framework is primarily written in JavaScript with a little bit of TypeScript code.

Mongoose is used as an interface to MongoDB by defining models to interact with the database. Some interactions that users can do include querying and any other SQL commands. This makes it necessary for users to use to access a MongoDB database. Additionally, it also enforces strongly-typed schemas as well. Overall the library aims to make working with MongoDB easier for developers with the features mentioned above. 

People who maintain mongoose are a team or company called Automattic. This company also maintains a bunch of other websites or applications like Tumblr, Jetpack, and Gravatar. The Automattic company is in charge of approving changes to the code.
